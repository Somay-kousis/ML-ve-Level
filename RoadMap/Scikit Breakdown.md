Based on your ML roadmap, you're in **Week 2: First Real ML Project**. Looking at the scikit-learn documentation you've provided, here are the specific sections you need to focus on this week:

## Week 2 Breakdown

### Day 1-3: Scikit-learn Basics

**Sections to Study from your document:**

**1.1.1** - **Ordinary Least Squares** (LinearRegression)

- Understanding the basic linear regression
- Learning `coef_` and `intercept_` attributes
- Understanding the mathematical foundation

**1.1.2** - **Ridge Regression**

- Understanding regularization concepts
- Learning when to use Ridge vs regular linear regression
- Understanding the `alpha` parameter

**1.1.18** - **Polynomial Regression**

- Extending linear models with basis functions
- Using `PolynomialFeatures` transformer
- Creating pipelines

### Day 4-7: Complete End-to-End Project

**Additional sections for your movie recommendation project:**

**1.1.11** - **Logistic Regression** (you'll need this for classification tasks)

- Binary and multinomial cases
- Understanding probability predictions

## Immediate Action Plan for This Week:

### Day 1 (Today): Linear Regression Deep Dive

1. **Study Section 1.1.1** thoroughly
2. **Code along** with the examples in the document
3. **Mini Project**: Build the house price predictor using:
    
    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegressionfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_splitfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    ```
    

### Day 2: Ridge Regression & Regularization

1. **Study Section 1.1.2**
2. **Compare** Ridge vs Linear Regression on the same dataset
3. **Experiment** with different alpha values

### Day 3: Polynomial Features

1. **Study Section 1.1.18**
2. **Practice** creating polynomial features
3. **Build** a non-linear model using polynomial features

### Day 4-7: Movie Recommendation Project

**Focus Areas:**

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Making predictions

## Sections to Study for Future Weeks:

### Week 3 (Classification):

- **1.1.11** - Logistic Regression (detailed study)
- **1.1.13** - Stochastic Gradient Descent
- **1.1.14** - Perceptron

### Week 4 (Unsupervised Learning):

- You'll need clustering algorithms (not in this document - you'll use scikit-learn's clustering module)

### Week 5 (Model Evaluation):

- **1.1.2.4** - Cross-validation techniques
- **1.1.3.1.1** - Cross-validation for Lasso

### For Your AI Therapist Bot (Later phases):

- **1.1.11** - Logistic Regression (for intent classification)
- **1.1.3** - Lasso (for feature selection in NLP)
- **1.1.10** - Bayesian Regression (for uncertainty quantification)

## This Week's Deliverables:

1. **House Price Predictor** (Days 1-3)
2. **Movie Recommendation System** (Days 4-7)
3. **GitHub repository** with both projects
4. **Understanding** of train/test split, model evaluation, and basic ML workflow

## Pro Tip:

Don't get overwhelmed by all the sections in the document. Focus only on **1.1.1, 1.1.2, and 1.1.18** this week. The other sections are reference material for later.

Start with **Section 1.1.1** right now - code the examples, understand the concepts, then build something with it!
