##  Loss Functions

#####  L1 Loss

$$
L1 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left| y_i - \hat{y}_i \right|
$$

---

#####  Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
**Definition**: The average of L1 losses across a set of $N$ examples.

$$
MAE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left| y_i - \hat{y}_i \right|
$$

---

#####  L2 Loss
**Definition**: The sum of the squared differences between predicted values $\hat{y}_i$ and actual values $y_i$.

$$
L2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2
$$

---

##### Mean Squared Error (MSE)
**Definition**: The average of L2 losses across a set of $N$ examples.

$$
MSE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2
$$

Outside the typical range and would be considered an Outlners


### Choosing Loss

Outliners are basically the weird ones 

MSE moves the model more toward the outliers, while MAE doesn't
L2 loss incurs a much higher penalty for an outlier than L1 loss
