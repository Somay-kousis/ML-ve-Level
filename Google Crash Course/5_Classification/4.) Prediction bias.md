Prediction bias is the difference between the mean of a model's [**predictions**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#prediction) and the mean of [**ground-truth**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#ground-truth) labels in the data

Prediction bias can be caused by:

- Biases or noise in the data, including biased sampling for the training set
- Too-strong regularization, meaning that the model was oversimplified and lost some necessary complexity
- Bugs in the model training pipeline
- The set of features provided to the model being insufficient for the task
