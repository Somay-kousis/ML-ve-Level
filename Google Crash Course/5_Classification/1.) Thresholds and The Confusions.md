- A probability above the threshold value are then assigned to the [**positive class**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#positive_class),
-  When the total of actual positives is not close to the total of actual negatives, the dataset is [**imbalanced**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#class_imbalanced_data_set)

###### This widget includes three toy datasets:

- **Separated**:- where positive examples and negative examples are generally well differentiated, with most positive examples having higher scores than negative examples.

- **Unseparated**:- where many positive examples have lower scores than negative examples, and many negative examples have higher scores than positive examples.

- **Imbalanced**:- containing only a few examples of the positive class.
