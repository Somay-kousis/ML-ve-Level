Core Components of SVL are 

- Data :-     
    We store related data in datasets. <u><i>Datasets</i></u> are made up of individual examples that contain features and a label. <u><i>Features</u></i> is the data used to find the answer known a <u><i>Label</u></i>   ![[labeled_example.png]] 

- Model :-        
    Complex collection of numbers that define the mathematical relationship


- Training :- 
    The model finds the best solution by comparing its predicted value to the label's actual value. Based on the difference between the predicted and actual values— defined as the loss—the model gradually updates its solution.
    
    During training, ML practitioners can make subtle adjustments to the configurations
    
    Suppose a weather dataset contains`time_of_day` as a feature. In this case, an ML  practitioner can add or remove `time_of_day` during training to see whether the model makes better predictions with or without it.![[training-a-model-03.png]]


- Evaluating :-
    When we evaluate a model, we use a labeled dataset, but we only give the model the dataset's features. We then compare the model's predictions to the label's true values.![[evaluating-a-model.png]]
