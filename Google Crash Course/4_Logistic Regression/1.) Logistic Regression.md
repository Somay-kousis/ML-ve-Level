It's all about probability 


$$
y' = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$

$$
z = \beta + \omega_1 x_1 + \omega_2 x_2 + \dots + \omega_n x_n 
$$

- B0 is the bias.
- w1...Wn are weights
- x feature vale

- _z_ is the output of the linear equation, also called the [**log odds**](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#log-odds).
- _y'_ is the output of the logistic regression model.
