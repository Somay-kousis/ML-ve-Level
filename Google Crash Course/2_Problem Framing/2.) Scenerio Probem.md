### **Scenario Overview**

You want to **cache videos smartly** based on how many views they’re predicted to get. You have three rules:

* **Expensive cache** if **predicted views ≥ 50**
* **Cheap cache** if **30 ≤ predicted views < 50**
* **No cache** if **predicted views < 30**

### **Initial Plan: Regression Model**

You're predicting the **number of views** a video will get — this naturally suggests a **regression model** (which outputs continuous numbers).

But here’s the **problem**:

* Suppose the actual number of views is 30.
* Your model predicts 28 or 32.
* A regression model sees both as equally wrong by 2 units.
* But **your app's behavior is very different**:

  * 28 → **No cache**
  * 32 → **Cheap cache**

So even though the numerical error is the same, the impact on the **product is NOT the same**.

### **Why This Is a Problem**

The **regression loss function** (like Mean Squared Error) doesn’t know about your **view thresholds**. It just cares about getting close to the actual number. But you care more about **what “cache zone” the prediction lands in**.

---

### **The Fix: Use a Classification Model Instead**

Instead of predicting the **exact number** of views, you can predict **which caching category** the video belongs to.

Turn it into a **3-class classification problem**:

| Predicted Class | Meaning               |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| Class 0         | No cache (<30 views)  |
| Class 1         | Cheap cache (30-49)   |
| Class 2         | Expensive cache (≥50) |

Your model now predicts categories directly.

* If the video is **class 2**, use the **expensive cache**.
* If it’s **class 1**, use the **cheap cache**.
* If it’s **class 0**, don’t cache it.

This approach **respects your product logic**:

* Predicting class 1 when it should be class 2 gives **higher loss** than predicting class 1 when it should be class 1.
* The model will be penalized for misclassifying around your key thresholds (30 and 50), which aligns with your caching strategy.

---

### **Alternative Hybrid Approach (Optional & Advanced)**

If you still want to use regression for granularity but respect thresholds:

* Train a regression model to predict views.
* Add a **custom loss function** that penalizes crossing a caching boundary.
* OR use **regression + post-processing**: Predict views, then apply your own logic to categorize and cache.

---

### ✅ **TL;DR**

* **Regression** is good when small numeric errors are okay.
* But **your business logic is sensitive to thresholds** (30 and 50).
* So use a **classification model** with 3 classes: no cache, cheap cache, expensive cache.
* It aligns better with your app’s behavior and decision-making.
